# TicTacToe
Tic Tac Toe written in React Native

Once launching the app via `npx react-native start` and `npx react-native run-ios` (or run-android) you can enter the names of two players, and then begin the game by clicking the "Go" button.

The winner's name and piece (X or O) will be displayed upon winning the game. 

From there you have the option of playing again (which will take you back to the player name input screen) or never play again. Maybe the experience of playing your 900th JavaScript tic tac toe game will bring you back to the days before computers and will ignite a long-forgotten spark to play tic tac toe in the dirt with sticks.

This could have been written with Redux or Mobx or some other state management, and reacting to device light/dark theme, but it seemed like overkill.
